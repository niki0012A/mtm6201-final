# mtm6201-final
This is my Bootstrap final for 2nd semester 
<hr>
<h1>Hi! My name is Anna Nikiforova</h1>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>
  This was my first full project using the Bootstrap Framework. It was quite interesting but also nerve-wracking. It has a completely different structure compared to what I'm used to. At first, it felt very unfamiliar since I had always built websites from scratch before. I often felt that writing my CSS from scratch would be faster and easier, but I still forced myself to learn the framework's classes. Over time, I got the hang of using Bootstrap and it became easier, though confusion still often occurred.
</p>
<h2>Difficulties</h2>
<p>
  The hardest part was figuring out how to optimize for different devices when the layout of elements needed to change significantly. I explored all possible ways to handle this with "col", but still ended up using CSS. It was also unusual to work with a new type of markup because HTML code needed to be written with "row" in mind from the start, and I frequently had to go back and make changes.
</p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
  I understand that I need to learn various frameworks because it's a standard in my profession. When you fully understand what and how you are doing, it significantly speeds up your work. However, I felt that we spent too little time learning this type of work to handle such a complex and extensive project. I’m glad that by the end of this project, I had a much better understanding of how this type of framework works. But there is still much for me to learn. Overall, I’m satisfied with the result I achieved.
